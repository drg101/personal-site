                                In the first half of 2019 as I was finishing high school, I decided it was time to put my self-taught Unity skills to work. In high school, I played quite alot
                                of first person shooter (FPS) games, so I decided that would be the type of game I would make.

                                A great example of what I've been doing is illustrated by this animation, in which 50+ megabytes of county income information is rendered at blisteringly fast speeds onto a Leaflet map, all on a mediocre internet connection. Much
                                of this acceleration is due to novel hashing techniques which I implemented on the server and client.

                            For the term project for my Operating Systems class, we were expected to build some sort of containerized application using Kubernetes and Docker.
